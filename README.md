# Code Refactoring Playground

The Code Refactoring Playground is an interactive learning experience focused on
practical application and understanding of refactoring code through the use of
design patterns. 

During this class students will gain experience in refactoring and pattern recognition
by working on a fictitious application named Pattern Ticketeer. Students will also
learn about several key design patterns and what they look like in real-world code.

Each session will build upon the previous as we continue to add features to Pattern
Ticketeer while contending with previous design choices. By the end of the class
students will have experience in refactoring code and implementing common design
patterns.

# Session 1

In session 1, we will begin work on a new application named PatternTicketeer. It
is a task management system where uses can create tickets and change their
state. 

To get all the details, read the [FRD](frd.md).

## Preparation

- Read the [FRD](frd.md).
- Ensure your system is setup with the [prerequisites](pattern-ticketeer/README.md).
- Review the included [included code](pattern-ticketeer).
- Optionaly, attempt to complete the requested features.

## Session

Make sure you are ready to write code and ask questions!
